git branch - lists all branches and the one is with *
git checkout master - selects the master branch
git add . -A - actually indexes files in the dir so you can erase files (fuck you, git, fuck you Linus and all you hipster people making this disaster a standard)
git pull origin master
git push origin +master - overpowers whining about HEAD being mismatched

tree -a # plots tree directory structure
